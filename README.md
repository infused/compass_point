## Compatibility

Compass Point is tested to work with the following versions of ruby:

* MRI Ruby 2.0.x, 2.1.x, 2.2.x, 2.3.x, 2.4.x, 2.5.x
* JRuby 1.7.x

## Installation

    gem install compass_point

## Basic Usage

### Azimuth

Given an string such as "NW", "SE", "Northeast by east", or "N 20째 W", `azimuth` will
return the corresponding azimuth in degrees from 0 to 360:

    CompassPoint.azimuth('N') #=> 0.0
    CompassPoint.azimuth('S') #=> 180.0
    CompassPoint.azimuth('swbs') #=> 213.75
    CompassPoint.azimuth('Northeast by east') #=> 56.25
    CompassPoint.azimuth('N 20째 W') #=> 340

You can also get the minimum and maximum azimuths for any
abbreviation with `min`, `max` and `min_max`:

    CompassPoint.min('E') #=> 84.38
    CompassPoint.max('E') #=> 95.62
    CompassPoint.min('Northeast by east') #=> 50.63
    CompassPoint.max('Northeast by east') #=> 61.87
    CompassPoint.min_max('E') #=> [84.38, 95.62]
    CompassPoint.min_max('Northeast by east') #=> [50.63, 61.87]

Get the full name for an abbreviation:

    CompassPoint.name('NNW') #=> "North northwest"
    CompassPoint.name('SEbS') #=> "Southeast by south"


### Compass Quadrant Bearing

Given an azimuth, calculate the compass quadrant bearing.  For
example:

    CompassPoint.compass_quadrant_bearing(103) #=> "S 77째 E"
    CompassPoint.compass_quadrant_bearing(340) #=> "N 20째 W"
    CompassPoint.compass_quadrant_bearing(0) #=> "N"
